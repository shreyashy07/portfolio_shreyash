Professional Design: Make sure your portfolio looks polished and professional. Whether it’s printed or digital, the overall aesthetic matters and reflects your attention to detail.
User-Friendly Navigation: Especially for digital portfolios, ensure that users can easily navigate your site or document. Prioritize clarity over complexity.
Be Selective: Include your best work, rather than every project you’ve ever done. Tailor your portfolio to the specific purpose or audience.
Show Your Process: Include explanations of how you work, not just the end result. This demonstrates your thinking, approach, and problem-solving abilities.
Mobile Compatibility: If your portfolio is online, ensure it’s optimized for mobile devices, as many people will view it on their phones or tablets.
Keep It Updated: Regularly update your portfolio with new work and remove outdated or less-relevant pieces.
